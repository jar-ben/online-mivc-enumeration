\begin{abstract} 
Symbolic model checkers can construct proofs of
safety properties over complex models, but when a proof succeeds,
the results do not generally provide much insight to
the user. For explanation of the correctness, Minimal Inductive Validity Cores (MIVCs) can be used. Every MIVC traces the property to a minimal set of model elements necessary
for constructing a proof. 
The traceability information provided by MIVCs can be used to perform a variety of engineering analysis such as a coverage analysis, a robustness analysis or a vacuity detection. 
The more MIVCs are identified, the more precise analyses can be performed. 
However, a full enumeration of all MIVCs
is in general intractable due to the combinatorial explosion.

The bottleneck of existing algorithms is that they identify all MIVCs simultaneously at the very end of the computation.
Thus they output no MIVC in the cases where the complete enumeration is intractable. 
In this paper, we propose an algorithm that identifies MIVCs in an \emph{online} manner (i.e., one by one)
and can be terminated anytime.
We benchmark our algorithm against existing algorithms on a variety of benchmarks. We show that our algorithm not only is the winner in the intractable cases but also completes the enumeration sooner in many tractable cases.
