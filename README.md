# online-mivc-enumeration
This repository serve as a supporting material for the the paper [1] presenting the algorithm Grow-Shrink for online enumeration of minimal inductive validity cores (MIVCs). For a complete description of the algorithm, see the referenced paper. The algorithm was implemented in the JKind model checker and is currently available at https://github.com/jar-ben/jkind/tree/newalgorithm-shrink-tracking. In the future, we plan to include the algorithm in the master branch of JKind repository. 
Experimental data and complete results of the experiments are available at https://github.com/jar-ben/online-mivc-enumeration/tree/master/experiments.
