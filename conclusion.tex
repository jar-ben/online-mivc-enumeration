In this paper, we have presented an {\em online} computation for minimal Inductive Validity Cores (MIVCs) that substantially outperforms previous approaches.  As opposed to the {\em Offline MARCO} algorithm in~\cite{Ghass17AllIVCs}, it is guaranteed to produce minimal IVCs.  As opposed to a n\"aive extension {\em Online MARCO}, the new algorithm is substantially faster and requires fewer solver calls as the number of MIVCs increases.  We believe that this new algorithm will substantially increase the applicability of software engineering tasks that require MIVCs.  In the future, we hope to examine parallel computation of MIVCs using a variant of this algorithm to further increase scalability.
